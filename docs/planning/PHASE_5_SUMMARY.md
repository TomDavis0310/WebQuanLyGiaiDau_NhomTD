  - Team CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Player management within teams
  - Tournament registration/unregistration
  - Future tournament filtering

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach

**Problem:** API signature mismatch
- Existing methods: `getMyTeams({String? token})` (named parameters)
- New screens: `getMyTeams(token)` (positional parameters)

**Solution:** Option B - Updated all screens to match existing patterns
- Maintained codebase consistency
- No API duplication
- Token auto-managed by service layer
- 20+ compilation errors â†’ 0 errors

---

## ðŸ“Š Metrics

- **Total Code:** ~3,585 lines
- **Files Created:** 9 (1 backend, 3 models, 5 screens)
- **Files Modified:** 1 (api_service.dart)
- **Compilation Errors Fixed:** 20+ â†’ 0
- **Development Time:** ~4 hours

1. Backend API testing (Postman/Swagger)
2. Flutter UI testing (emulator/device)
3. End-to-end integration testing
4. Production deployment
5. Phase 6/7 development
